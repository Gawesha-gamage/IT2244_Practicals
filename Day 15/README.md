1.01.Prompts the user to enter an integer number.

02.Creates three child processes using fork():
Child 1 (C1): Calculates and prints the factorial of the entered number.
Child 2 (C2): Calculates and prints 2 raised to the power of the entered number.
Child 3 (C3): Calculates and prints the square of the entered number.

03.Each child should also print its parent process ID.

04.The parent process should:
/rint its own process ID.
Wait for all three child processes to complete before terminating.
