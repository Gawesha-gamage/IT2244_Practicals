Question:Get the user input for three numbers (a,b,c).Calculate the LCM(Least Common Multiple) for first two numbers(a,b) 
and calculate the GCD(Greatest Common Divisor) for last two numbers(b,c).



code:
echo "Enter the first number:"


read a


echo "Enter the second number:"


read b


echo "Enter the third number:"


read c


x=$a
y=$b


if [ $x -gt $y ]; then
          lcm=$x     ::if x is greater, set LCM to x
  else
            lcm=$y   ::if y is greater, set LCM to y
fi


while true; do

if [ $((lcm % x)) -eq 0 ] && [ $((lcm % y)) -eq 0 ]; then


echo "LCM of $x and $y is: $lcm"
break
fi

lcm=$((lcm + 1))
done


x=$b
y=$c

::loop to find the GCD
while [ $y -ne 0 ]; do
temp=$y           
y=$((x%y))        
x=$temp           
done

echo "GCD of $b and $c is:$x"
